Here's a complete `README.md` for resolving the issue with multiple `forge` binaries:

```md
# Resolving Multiple `forge` Binaries in PATH

If you encounter the following warning after installing `forge`:
```

There are multiple binaries with the name 'forge' present in your 'PATH'.
This may be the result of installing 'forge' using another method,
like Cargo or other package managers.

Follow these steps to resolve the issue:

## Steps to Fix

### 1. Remove the Old `forge` Binary

If you have an old `forge` binary installed via another method (e.g., Cargo), you can remove it. In this case, remove the binary located in `.cargo`:

```bash
rm /home/user/.cargo/bin/forge
```

### 2. Edit the `.bashrc` File to Prioritize the Correct `forge` Binary

1. Open the `.bashrc` file in the terminal using a text editor like `nano`:

   ```bash
   nano ~/.bashrc
   ```

2. Add the following line at the end of the file to ensure the correct version of `forge` from `/home/user/.foundry/bin` takes precedence:

   ```bash
   export PATH="/home/user/.foundry/bin:$PATH"
   ```

3. **Save the file** in `nano`:

   - Press `CTRL + O` to save the changes.
   - Press `Enter` to confirm.
   - Press `CTRL + X` to exit the editor.

4. **Apply the changes** by running:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

### 3. Verify the `forge` Version

To ensure that the correct `forge` version is being used, run:

```bash
forge --version
```

This should display the version installed in `/home/user/.foundry/bin`.

Now, your system will prioritize the correct `forge` binary!

```

This `README.md` provides a simple guide to fix the issue with multiple `forge` binaries and edit the `.bashrc` file.
